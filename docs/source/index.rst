quvac documentation
===================

Welcome to quvac documentation!

Quvac (from quantum vacuum, pronounced as qu-ack 🐸) allows to calculate quantum 
vacuum signals produced during light-by-light scattering. 

It uses the vacuum emission picture [1]_ to describe the corresponding transition amplitude
and the linear Maxwell solver to propagate external fields. The original idea of such code
was put forward in [2]_. Here we provide our implementation.
